Keep your gaze on labor made by feelings, mostly vague
But hey, the whole day, we obey, 'kay?
Any way's a draft that doesn't care about face
See, a curse that is wild in me
Who is next? Who's it gonna, who's it gonna be?
Well, no one is truly free, pit against this mess you leave

Bow wow
Giving you everything so far, all I have and including my heart
Drown the beat that flutters in me until it can't breathe, and I see
That I'll one day get out of this cage
Breaking this curse I could never escape
Then I'll hold you closer to me in a tender, warm embrace

Go on with my bad rep', and freely run ahead
Burn up with love and turn into dust, resound through what is left
Go like a rain that will never end or like a night that endures yet
Shout aloud with your fanfare and assault this town again

Pa-la-la-la-la
Pa-la-la-la-la
Pa-la-la-la-la
Pa-la-la-la-la

Mayday, mayday, mayday
Sleepless yet again, Friday
Ah-ah-ah scolded, chewed for theft so crude
Hey, teach', giving no shit about you

As I live, I wanna die yet die to survive
And then I choose a side to find that I'm fuckin' all alone, right
With all I gave away, it should be so plain
To the crowd, I cave, I'm the dog that you chained
Awoo

Ah, giving into chase, just to stop and run away
Though you catch and scold my ways
There's no helping how I really play
Lying right down 'cause I'm here to obey
I will dress up, do whatever you say
Wait for the day 'til the line here will change
And they're calling my name in vain

Now look at my "super toast" with jam I wanted the most
Spinning the days of the photos I made to stories I can boast
Go like a spread of a page or two, a frontispiece you once drew
Show what's behind this finale, full of shit and void of truth

Ah, this state of my own mind, my dreams will come to die
Finding out where truth lies, I crushed it down inside
Someone high above I don't know set this ball in place long ago
They stole our flag in one go and burned it for a show

Go on with my bad rep', and freely run ahead
Burn up with love and turn into dust, resound through what is left
Go like a rain that will never end or like a night that endures yet
Shout aloud with your fanfare and assault this town again
Shout aloud with your fanfare and assault this town again

It is your fault that I'm lonely, now I see
You have destroyed me
