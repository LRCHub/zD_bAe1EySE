Did you know
The east was a dessert
I had a feeling I met you before
Is it because
I move without being present
Toward the sun
I don't know where did it go
Don't Lie
God like
People
Fake.
They're
Cheaters
Preachers
All The Same
We had it all
Stories From The Dogland
Pigs flying
All printed in gold
While you were dancing
Sipping Polo-Cocta
I dug a whole under the fence

White Lies
Imply
God - Like Fame
Preachers
Hookers
Give and Take
Love/Come
Money/Try It
Time/End
Dirt/Shake
Fame/Home
Terror/Secret
Glamour/Shooting
Faith/Waste
You've got a point
We're coming empty handed
Single Minded
And hard as fist
We come and go
Fighting to Surrender
The kings of Liars
That you cannot resist
